# Welcome to another Student Zone at Microsoft Build 2021!

This README contains resources related to sessions at the Student Zone from Microsoft Build 2021!

## What is Microsoft Build?

[Microsoft Build](https://mybuild.microsoft.com/) is Microsoft's professional developer conference where, you guessed it, professional developers come 
to confer! By that, we mean where developers come to learn about how Microsoft can better support their
unique developer journey. There are technical sessions, opportunities to meet and talk with experts, and 
the chance to discover and grow a technical community.

## What is the Student Zone?

Each year at Microsoft Build we create a session track specifically aimed at student developers: the [Student Zone](https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions?t=%257B%2522from%2522%253A%25222021-05-25T00%253A00%253A00-07%253A00%2522%252C%2522to%2522%253A%25222021-05-27T23%253A59%253A00-07%253A00%2522%257D&f=%255B%257B%2522name%2522%253A%2522Student%2520Zone%2522%252C%2522facetName%2522%253A%2522topic%2522%257D%255D). The target age
for our **student** developers is 14-21 years old, though that is really just there to guide us in scoping 
the content we create for you. So if you're outside of these exact ages, you still might find this content 
useful for your coding journey! This may be perfect for you if you're a career switcher or an even just a beginner!

## How can I find the resources mentioned in the Student Zone sessions?

Below we have a table of each session, speaker, and resources (as well as links to the live session or video recording)! Each of our sessions is 45-mintues long. 

We have also created a convenient [Microsoft Learn Collection](https://aka.ms/studentzone-3) that contains all of the Microsoft Learn modules and learning paths that are listed below for you to browse and continue your learning journey!
