# Welcome to the Student Zone at Microsoft Build 2021!

Explore this repository to find starter code for some of the projects and demos from the Student Zone, and check out [Learn TV](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/tv/) for more amazing resources.

## What is Microsoft Build?
Microsoft's professional developer conference where, you guessed it, professional developers come 
to confer! By that, we mean where developers come to learn about how Microsoft can better support their
unique developer journey. There were technical sessions, opportunities to meet and talk with experts, and 
the chance to discover and grow a technical community.

## What is the Student Zone?
Each year at Microsoft Build we create a session track specifically aimed at student developers. The target age
for our **student** developers is 14-21 years old, though that is really just there to guide us in scoping 
the content we create for you. So if you're a bit outside of these exact ages, you still might find this content 
useful for your coding journey! This may be perfect for you if you're a career switcher or a even just a beginner!

## How can I find the resources mentioned in the Student Zone sessions?
Here are the sessions, speakers, slides, and videos of all Student Zone sessions from this year!

| Session Code | Topic | Speaker | Resources | Slides  | Video on Demand |
