# Sandesh Chinchole was at MS Build 2020

> My first time attending MS Build. It was an exhilarating experience!

As a student developer, the learning opportunity provided by MS Build was invaluable. The virtual sessions, focus groups, and
student zone were fun. Thanks to all the developers, advocates, educators, Microsoft employees and of course Microsoft ;)
