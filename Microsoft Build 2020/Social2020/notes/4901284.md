# Tan Wei Liang Nathanael was at Microsoft Build 2020!

> Really enjoying the sessions a lot, with the humour, the light-hearted tone and the engaging speakers and moderators.

COVID-19 has brought us a lot of inconvenience but I tend to look on the brighter side of the picture, which is how Microsoft Build 2020 went digital and that means it's easily accessible for people anywhere and at anytime!

I wouldn't want to fly everywhere just to attend seminars when I can attend as much as I like from the comfort of my own home!
