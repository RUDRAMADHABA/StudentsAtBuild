# [DariaNico](https://github.com/DariaNico) here to say, "HIYA MS Build 2020!!"

> I've finally made it in! (in the ssh sense)

It took me a day of sshing and accidentally cloning master and not my forked branch, but here I am!

**Terrible** *Wonderful* Things Build has Inspired:
* Set up ssh for the first time on Windows
* Set up a Ruby/Rails dev environment on Windows (with wsl)
* Rewrite my resume with LaTeX
* Figure out how to dev with Azure
* Begin Sketchnoting
* Learn Python and C++
* Begin my DevOps journey
* AI and Machine Learning!!
