I could have been in the "Build" in person, but I loved to present it virtually!

Feel free to connect with me on> https://luciomsp.github.io/

``` csharp
  using System;
					
public class Program
{
	public static void Main()
	{
		int me = 1;
		while (!Succeed(me++)) { Console.WriteLine("EAT. WORK. PLAY. SLEEP. REPEAT."); }
	}
	
	public static bool Succeed(int cnt)
	{
		return cnt==2;
	}
	
	public static bool Succeed()
	{
		return false;
	}
}

   ```
